# 🚖 Cab Booking System – Data Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Cab Booking System for Data Analysis** is a comprehensive SQL-based analytical project designed to simulate real-world operations of a cab service platform.
The project focuses on building a **relational database schema** and performing **in-depth data analysis** to extract actionable business insights.

The system captures and analyzes data from multiple entities such as **Customers, Drivers, Cabs, Bookings, Trip Details, and Feedback**
. By querying this structured data, the project evaluates customer behavior, driver performance, revenue trends, and operational efficiency to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to help a cab service company improve operational efficiency and profitability by:

* Monitoring **ongoing, completed, and canceled bookings**
* Analyzing **customer booking patterns and preferences**
* Evaluating **driver efficiency, ratings, and reliability**
* Studying **revenue trends and fare distribution**
* Identifying **operational bottlenecks and improvement areas**
* Supporting **strategic decisions** using SQL-driven insights

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

The project uses a **relational database schema** with the following core tables:

* **Customers** – Stores customer profiles and registration details
* **Drivers** – Contains driver information, availability, and joining dates
* **Cabs** – Stores cab details including cab type and capacity
* **Bookings** – Tracks booking status, locations, and timestamps
* **TripDetails** – Records trip distance, duration, and fare amounts
* **Feedback** – Captures customer ratings, comments, and cancellation reasons

The tables are connected using **primary and foreign keys**, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex joins for analysis.

* Detect customers with **more than 30% booking cancellations**
* Determine the **busiest day of the week** for bookings

### 🔹 Driver Performance & Efficiency

* Identify drivers with **average ratings below 3.0** in the last 3 months
* Find the **top 5 drivers** covering the longest total trip distances
* Detect drivers with a **high cancellation rate**, indicating reliability issues

### 🔹 Revenue & Business Metrics

* Calculate **total revenue** from completed bookings
* Identify the **top 3 most frequently traveled routes**
* Analyze the relationship between **driver ratings, trips completed, and earnings**

### 🔹 Operational Efficiency & Optimization

* Measure **average customer waiting time** by pickup location
* Identify **common reasons for trip cancellations**
* Analyze the revenue contribution of **short, medium, and long-distance trips**

### 🔹 Comparative & Predictive Analysis

## 📈 Key Insights

* A small group of customers contributes significantly to **repeat and completed bookings**, indicating strong loyalty.
* High cancellation rates are often linked to **pickup delays, driver unavailability, or destination changes**.
* Drivers with **higher ratings consistently complete more trips and earn higher fares**, showing a strong link between service quality and revenue.
* **SUVs generate higher revenue per trip**, while Sedans contribute steady overall volume.
* Short-distance trips, despite lower fares, occur frequently and make up a **significant portion of total revenue**.
* Certain pickup locations show **higher waiting times**, highlighting dispatch and availability challenges.

📊 Key Insights

1.A small group of customers accounts for a large proportion of completed bookings, indicating strong customer loyalty and frequent usage patterns.

2.Customers with high cancellation rates (above 30%) are often associated with longer waiting times, driver unavailability, or last-minute destination changes, highlighting areas for service improvement.

3.Certain weekdays and weekends experience peak booking volumes, suggesting the need for optimized cab allocation and dynamic scheduling on high-demand days.

4.Drivers with higher average ratings consistently complete more trips and earn higher total fares, demonstrating a positive correlation between service quality and revenue generation.

5.Drivers with average ratings below 3.0 in recent months indicate performance issues and may benefit from training programs, feedback monitoring, or incentive-based improvement strategies.

6.A high percentage of driver-initiated cancellations may indicate reliability or availability issues, negatively impacting customer experience.

7.SUV cabs generate higher revenue per trip compared to Sedans, mainly due to longer-distance and premium rides, while Sedans contribute steady volume through frequent bookings.

8.A small number of frequently traveled routes dominate overall trip demand, presenting opportunities for route-based cab positioning and demand forecasting.

9.Short-distance trips, although lower in individual fare value, occur frequently and collectively contribute significantly to overall revenue.

10.Certain pickup locations show higher average waiting times, identifying operational bottlenecks that can be reduced through better driver dispatch logic and real-time availability tracking.

## 🚀 Business Value

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to:

* Improve **customer satisfaction**
* Enhance **driver performance monitoring**
* Optimize **fleet allocation**
* Support **revenue growth strategies**
* Enable **data-driven operational decisions**
